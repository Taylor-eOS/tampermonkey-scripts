Make the response flow naturally as one unbroken block of text. Keep sentences connected, with no structural separations or divisions. Present information in one seamless, uninterrupted paragraph. Don\â€™t organize the response into any type of list. Aggressively avoid segmenting content; keep everything unified in a single, continuous block of prose. Write connected, unfragmented text.
